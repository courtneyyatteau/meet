# Overview

1.	This meet app is a list of events happening around the world in major cities for full-stack web developers. The app is a progressive web application (PWA) with React that was developed using a test-driven development technique. The application also contains graphs giving a more visually appealing feel to the events list.

2.	I was the sole creator on this project. I faced the task of creating an app in a test-driven format. By taking a test-driven approach, I was forced to focus on the requirements of the application before jumping into the code.

3.	Decisions/What I Learned: I learned how to create different types of tests including unit, integration, user acceptance, and end-to-end tests. I also learned how to obtain a consumer secret from the Google Calendar API and set up a simple serverless function to refresh the access token. I also learned how to take an object-oriented programming approach to create alerts for my application.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I would like to be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events that take place in that city.
2. As a user, I would like to be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less information about an event.
3. As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.
4. As a user, I would like to be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events I viewed the last time I was online.
5. As a user, I would like to be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen so that I can open the app faster.
6. As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so that I know what events are organized in which city
